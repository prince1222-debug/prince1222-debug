// const name = "prince"
// const gameCount = 80
// console.log(name + "'s gameCount is " + gameCount ) This is the Older way to concatenate strings
// You can use this below for string interpolation
// console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my gamecount is ${gameCount}`) 

// Below is the other way to declare string

// const gameName = new String('valorant-fpp-tpp');

// console.log(gameName[0]); // this will result the first letter of the valorant word
// console.log(gameName.__proto__); // this will help you to know this string is an object
// console.log(gameName.length); // this will result the lenght of valorant word

// console.log(gameName.toUpperCase); // this will make the world valorant in uppercase and didn't change the orginal string
// console.log(gameName.charAt(4)) // this will help you to know that which character is at index 4 or any index
// console.log(gameName.indexOf("l")) // this will help you to know that at which index the character "l" is



// console.log(gameName.substring(0, 5)) // In substring you can choose that the particular word you need to get and in this you have to use index and negative index is not allowed 
// console.log(gameName.slice(-8, 5)) // In slice you can do as same as substring but you can choose negative index 

// const newString = "   prince   "
// console.log(newString.trim) // trim will help you to trim the empty space of the string.

// const url = "https://prince%23khdfsci%23prince"
// console.log(url.replace("%23", "-")) // using replace you can replace the string 
// console.log(url.includes("prince")) // using includes you can know that prince is in the string and throw the result in booleans

// console.log(gameName.split('-'));
